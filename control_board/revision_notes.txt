Fix bridge rectifier pinout
    Done, footprint 2 -> datasheet 3
Check bridge rectifier footprint with actual part
	Done, no change needed
Thermal relief on linear reg ground
    Done, removed
Remove pulldown resistor on /RESET output from WDT
    Done, removed
Consider hooking /RESET up to only one logic gate input
    Done, decided not to: ok on modified rev 1, input impedance order of magnitude high enough
Consider placing cap between /RESET and GND, 2.2uF should be ok
    Done, placed
Remove polyfuse F5 or place it before linear reg
    Done, removed
Reduce width of C1 pads
Increase space between C2 and C3 to enable easier soldering
Consider reducing length/long dimension of F1 & F2
    Done, new footprint
Consider moving RV1 to the right
Clear other-net vias from space between cap pins
Evaluate position of J1, possibly move it up
    Done, rotated connector
Incrase size of RV1 pin holes
    Done, added 4 mils
Test screw fitmet, especially around nano
    Done, fit is good, might be problematic if arduino mounted closer
Round corners of PCB
    Done

Analog taps:
IO pin between 1k resistors on thermister pullup
    Done
AREF <-> 330 <-> IO pin
    Done
AREF <-> 1k <-> IO pin
    Done
