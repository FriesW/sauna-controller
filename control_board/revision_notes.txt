Fix bridge rectifier pinout
Check bridge rectifier footprint with actual part
Thermal relief on linear reg ground
Remove pulldown resistor on /RESET output from WDT
Consider hooking /RESET up to only one logic gate input
Reduce width of C1 pads
Increase space between C2 and C3 to enable easier soldering
Consider reducing length/long dimension of F1 & F2
Consider moving RV1 to the right
Clear other-net vias from space between cap pins
Evaluate position of J1, possibly move it up
Incrase size of RV1 pin holes
Test screw fitmet, especially around nano
