Fix bridge rectifier pinout
	Done, no change needed - Check bridge rectifier footprint with actual part
Thermal relief on linear reg ground
Remove pulldown resistor on /RESET output from WDT
Consider hooking /RESET up to only one logic gate input
Consider placing cap between /RESET and GND, 2.2uF should be ok
Remove polyfuse F5 or place it before linear reg
Reduce width of C1 pads
Increase space between C2 and C3 to enable easier soldering
Consider reducing length/long dimension of F1 & F2
Consider moving RV1 to the right
Clear other-net vias from space between cap pins
Evaluate position of J1, possibly move it up
Incrase size of RV1 pin holes
Test screw fitmet, especially around nano

Analog taps:
IO pin between 1k resistors on thermister pullup
AREF <-> 330 <-> IO pin
AREF <-> 1k <-> IO pin
